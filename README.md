# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

# Frontend
- HTML5: For semantic structuring of content.
- CSS3: Enhances aesthetics and responsiveness with:
  - Custom animations and hover effects.
  - Mobile-first design principles.
- JavaScript: Handles dynamic user interactions and API requests efficiently.

# API
- GitHub REST API:
  - Fetches user profile data and repositories dynamically.
  - Enables real-time updates based on user input.

# External Libraries
- Axios:
  - Simplifies HTTP requests to fetch data from GitHub‚Äôs API.
  - Provides structured error handling for improved user feedback.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

# 1. User Interaction
- Users type a GitHub username into the search bar.
- On form submission, the application validates the input and initiates an API request.
# 2. API Data Fetch
- GitHub user data is fetched using the REST API endpoint:  
  `https://api.github.com/users/{username}`
- Repository data is fetched using:  
  `https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos?sort=created`
# 3. Data Rendering
- The fetched data is rendered into responsive and visually appealing cards:
  - Profile Card: Displays avatar, bio, and follower stats.
  - Repository Links: Show clickable links to recent repositories.
# 4. Error Management
- If a username doesn‚Äôt exist, an error card is displayed with a clear message.
- Issues with API requests (e.g., network errors) are also handled gracefully.

# üé® User Interface Design
# Profile Card
- Circular **avatar** with a hover zoom effect.
- Detailed user statistics rendered in an **info block** with a subtle shadow for depth.
- A cohesive color scheme enhances readability and visual appeal.
# Repository Links
- Styled as clickable buttons with rounded edges and vibrant colors.
- Hover animations make interactions more engaging.
# Error Messages
- Displayed as centered cards with bold, prominent text.
- Uses contrasting colors to capture the user's attention effectively.

# üíª **Code Structure**

### **1. HTML**
- **Form Element**: Contains the input field for GitHub username.
- **Main Element**: Acts as a container for dynamic content such as profile cards and repository links.

### **2. CSS**
- **Global Styles**:
  - Utilizes a minimalist reset for cross-browser compatibility.
  - A clean, modern typography with a focus on readability.
- **Component-Specific Styles**:
  - Input Box: Rounded edges, subtle shadows, and focus effects.
  - Profile Card: Flexible layout for content alignment and responsiveness.
  - Repository Buttons: Smooth transitions and hover states.

### **3. JavaScript**
- **Modular Functions**:
  - `userGetFunction(name)`: Fetches user details from the API.
  - `repoGetFunction(name)`: Retrieves repositories of the user.
  - `userCard(user)`: Dynamically creates a profile card.
  - `repoCardFunction(repos)`: Displays repository links.
  - `errorFunction(error)`: Handles errors and renders an appropriate message.
- **Event Listener**:
  - Captures form submissions and triggers the API fetch functions.

## üì± **Responsive Design**

GitSpot adapts flawlessly to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Displays profile cards and repositories side-by-side.
- **Mobile**: Cards stack vertically for better readability and navigation.
- **Tablet**: Ensures elements are proportionately sized without crowding.

Media queries adjust layout and font sizes to provide a consistent experience.
